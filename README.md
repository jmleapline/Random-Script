# Justin's Random Scripts

Just some random scripts that I have made over the years. 

## Scripts

- **checkcc** / from the command line, check to see if the passed credit card number is valid using the luhn check.
- **sshc** / keep track of the boxes you ssh to with a JSON file (servers.json). helps when you don't ssh to boxes very often, and you're like "What is that hostname again???".

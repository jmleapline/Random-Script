# Justin's Random Scripts

Just some random scripts that I have made over the years. 

## Scripts

- **ccn** / from the command line, check to see if the passed credit card number is valid using the luhn check. Also generate a list of validate card numbers given the first six, last four passed.
- **sshc** / keep track of the boxes you ssh to with a JSON file (servers.json). helps when you don't ssh to boxes very often, and you're like "What is that hostname again???".
- **service** / got tired of grepping my history on the commands I ran. Wrote a quick script to mimic Redhat's service command. The file is a JSON file that you can configure. Even can configure using sudo and run multiple commands at once.
